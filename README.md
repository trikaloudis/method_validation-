Analytical Method Validation AnalyzerThis is a Streamlit web application designed to perform basic statistical analysis and visualization for analytical method validation data.FeaturesUpload Data: Users can upload an Excel file containing their validation data.Dynamic Grouping: Calculates summary statistics (Mean, SD, %RSD, Min, Max, N, Mean % Recovery) for each compound. Data is always grouped by concentration Level and can be further grouped by Analyst or Sample.Collapsible Views: Statistics are presented in a clean, collapsible table.Interactive Plots: Generates interactive boxplots of % Recovery vs. Level for each compound, allowing for easy identification of outliers and trends.Data Format RequirementThe application requires a specific format for the input Excel file.The file must be an .xlsx file.It must contain a sheet explicitly named Validation data.The columns in the Validation data sheet must be as follows:ColumnHeader NameDescriptionData TypeAIndexUnique identifier or row number for each sampleAnyBDateDate of the analysisText/DateCAnalystName of the analyst performing the measurementTextDSampleDescription or type of the sample matrixTextEUnitsMeasurement units (e.g., mg/L, ppm)TextFLevelThe true or spiked concentration of the sampleNumberGNotesAny relevant notes by the analystTextH ->[Compound Name]Measurement data for each compound.NumberNote: Columns from H onwards should contain the names of the compounds in the first row, followed by the numerical measurement data.How to Run LocallyClone the repository:git clone [your-repository-url]
